# LinkedIn Job Scraping

## Overview

This project is a Python script designed to scrape recent job postings from LinkedIn for Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in India. It uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract job details, including the company name, job title, location, and more. The extracted data is then saved in both JSON and CSV formats.

## Features

- **Extracts** details such as job title, company, location, LinkedIn job ID, posted date, seniority level, and employment type.
- **Saves** data in JSON and CSV formats.
- **Provides** real-time progress updates during scraping.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup4

## Setup

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
    Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
